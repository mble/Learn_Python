[Zed A. Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way](http://http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) Exercises w/ Comments

All the exercises in .py format with comments explaining much of the stuff as the author recommends. Also assorted .txt files associated with each exercises. Need to sort into folders at some point to keep relevant materials together.
